This contains the replication data for Bisbee and Honig (2022), Flight to Safety: COVID-Induced Changes in the Intensity of Status Quo Preference and Voting Behavior, as part of the Institute for Replications efforts.
The folder "Main Replication" contains our replication material for the paper's main results, testing the effect of COVID exposure on voting for Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Primary.
The folder "US House Primaries Replication" contains our replication material for the tests looking at the effect of COVID-19 on voting for anti-establishment candidates in the US House Primary.
All other folders contain the original replication materials from Bisbee and Honig (2022). All materials there were created by them. The original source can be found here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/S5YMS7
We would like to thank Bisbee and Honig for making their materials public, and for the hard work that went into their original paper.
